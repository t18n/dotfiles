## Introduction

My dotfiles backup that ultilizes [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) and [Mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup). I recommend to read up the tools to understand how they work.

> NOTE: Please read the instruction very carefully before you run any command, script on your _existing_ environment. I highly recommend to take the parts you use only and not `restore` everything on your computer, since a lot of these tools are configured spefically for my needs.

> **SERIOUSLY! [Fork this](https://github.com/turboninh/dotfiles/fork), remove stuff you don't use and make it your own.**

> NOTE: VSCode provide a sync feature which is much more sophisticated than dotfiles, so it is not used here.

> NOTE: Applications that doesn't store configuration files in `$HOME` or `$HOME/.config` are generally not included here.

### Security

The [mackup configuration](mackup/.mackup.cfg) consist of only `[applications_to_sync]` section to specifically limit what to sync. This avoid syncing any redundant files or files that includes sensitive information that you don't want to share.

## Getting started

### First steps

1. Clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:turboninh/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles && cd  ~/dotfiles`
2. Pull all submodules `git submodule update --init --recursive`
3. Choose your path
   1. _Clean PC_: Run bootstrap script `~/dotfiles/scripts/bootstrap-mac.sh`
   2. _Running PC_: `mackup backup`
4. Set ZSH as a main shell: `chsh -s $(which zsh)`

### Back up changes

Backup script is intentionally set up to run manually, which allow me to review changes before push, since this is a public repo. If you are interested in the automated script, checkout the `feat/with-automated-backup` branch for the `automate-backup.sh` script. Following is the manual flow:

1. Go to the directory `cd ~/dotfiles`
2. Run backup script `~/dotfiles/scripts/backup.sh`
3. Review changes and push commit

## My toolkit

Below are the main applications that I use, some of them are not included in this repo backup but I would love to share with you.

A lot of these tools are free thanks to the wonderful open-source contributors. If you love the tools, please consider to donate to appreciate their efforts.

## Project structure

Following diagram explains the main purpose of the repo structure

```sh
.
â”œâ”€â”€ mackup                          # Backup files = $HOME
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ .config                     # Backup files = $HOME/.config
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ .mackup                     # Folder for all backup apps config
â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ my-dotfiles.cfg         # Configuration for what files to backup
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ packages                    # A folder that consists of all packages that are managed through `git submodules`
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ .mackup.cfg                 # Mackup configuration file
â”œâ”€â”€ package_dump                    # A folder that consist of all globally installed packages dump files
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts:                        # All available scripts
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ backup.sh:                  # Script to run backup, dump files
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ bootstrap-mac.sh            # Script to bootstrap a new computer
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ sync-packages.sh            # Script tp install all dump packages from package_dump
â”œâ”€â”€ CHANGELOG.md                    # Manual changelog I use to journal my stack changes over time
â””â”€â”€ README.md                       # Main documentation
```

### Maintenance

## Manage backup

You can find the main mackup configuration [here](mackup/.mackup.cfg).

### Manage apps to sync or unsync

When you look into `mackup/.mackup` folder, you will see only the [my-dotfiles.cfg](mackup/.mackup/my-dotfiles.cfg) file. This is because I would like to have full control of what files I am backing up. I would recommend you to do the same.

To manage what app to sync, edit `mackup/.mackup.cfg`.

### Add apps to backup

I you want convenience, there are a bunch of supported applications. All supported applications can be found [here](https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/mackup/applications).

In case an application is not supported, you can add a `*.cfg` file to `./.mackup` folder.
Then update `mackup/.mackup.cfg`.

- `mackup restore`: Restore your application settings on a newly installed workstation
- `mackup restore`: Backup configurations from machine
- `mackup uninstall`: Revert mackup-modified files

## Git Submodules

Sometimes, a library might not be available as a installable package, or it is just a repo that consist of data (cowsay, fortunes, etc.), we use git `submodule` to download the packages as well as keeping them up-to-date.

- `git submodule add https://github.com/new_plugin.git mackup/packages/new_plugin`: Add a new submodule/package
- `git submodule update --init --recursive`: Update/pull all submodules
